# Predicting kickstart campaign success

The goal of this project was to predict the success of a Kickstarter campaign using machine learning.

After data cleaning and manual feature selection, 2 basic classifier models were deployed: logistic regression and random forest. More complex models including hyperparameter tuning, and additional models (SVM, XGBoost) are also ready to be deployed.
